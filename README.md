You are asked to create a vehicle classifier app that creates and manages vehicle instances. Implement a Python program to model this scenario.
Create a Vehicle entity with the following behvaiour:
start(): This method should print “Vehicle started.”
stop(): This method should print “Vehicle stopped.”
Create two more entities, Car and Motorcycle, which inherit from the Vehicle entity. The criteria are as follows:
In the Car class, the start() method should print “Car started” and the stop() method should print “Car stopped.”
In the Motorcycle class, the start() method should print “Motorcycle started” and the stop() method should print “Motorcycle stopped.”
Write a Python code snippet to demonstrate the usage of these classes.
